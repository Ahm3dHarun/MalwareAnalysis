# Malware Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze malware using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project (`data.csv`) contains features extracted from malware samples, with the last column indicating whether the sample is malicious (1) or non-malicious (0).

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset (`data.csv`) and preprocess it by separating features (X) and target labels (y).

2. **Dimensionality Reduction using PCA**: Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and visualize the data in 2D.

3. **Visualization with t-SNE**: Further visualize the dataset in 2D using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

4. **Clustering with K-Means**: Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster the data into two groups, representing malicious and non-malicious samples.

5. **Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Train a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to classify malware samples based on their features.

## Running the Project on Jupyter Notebook

To run this project on Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have installed the required dependencies, including `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset**: Ensure you have the dataset (`data.csv`) in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and create a new notebook or open an existing one.

4. **Copy and Paste Code**: Copy the provided code and paste it into a code cell in your Jupyter Notebook.

5. **Run the Code Cells**: Execute the code cells one by one to load the dataset, perform analysis, and visualize the results.

6. **Interpret Results**: Once the code execution is complete, interpret the results obtained from PCA, t-SNE visualization, K-Means clustering, and KNN classification.

7. **Customize and Experiment**: Feel free to customize the code, experiment with different algorithms, or modify the visualization techniques to suit your requirements.

### Note

Ensure that the dataset (`data.csv`) is properly formatted and contains at least two columns to avoid any potential errors during data loading and preprocessing. Additionally, make sure to handle any dependencies or environment-related issues that may arise during the execution of the code.
